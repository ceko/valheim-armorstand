## MOD Description

ValheimArmorstand is a mod that adds ways to display your armor and items on poseable models. Currently one piece is included, the armor stand. The stand has 7 different poses and can equip the following item slots:

* One-handed
* Two-handed
* Bow
* Shield
* Helmet
* Chest armor
* Leg armor
* Cape

## Installation

It's safest to have the mod installed on all clients and on the dedicated server if possible, but in limited playtesting the following scenarios work:

1) For dedicated servers only clients who want to use the mod need it installed. (if someone could verify this it would be nice)
2) For clients acting as servers (when you host the game), the server needs the mod installed at a minimum.
3) For single-player, you can enable and disable the mod at will. The mod has a separate backup file and will try to re-load armor stands when the mod is re-enabled.

**Automatic (preferred)**
Install with the mod manager link

**Manual**

1) Go to [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2) Download it and follow the installation manual
3) Drag the unzipped ValheimArmorstand folder into -> <Steam Location>\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx\plugin  

The next time you start your game, the mod will be enabled. To disable it, just remove it from the mods folder.

## Usage

The armor stand should appear in game through normal play in your furniture tab. If you are installing this mod on an existing playthrough, you will have to pick up items or re-order you inventory to learn the new pieces.

## Caveats and Warnings

1) This is an Alpha mod, and you are helping to playtest it.

2) You could lose items on the armor stand between Valheim patches. There is no Valheim mod support and they are free to pull the rug out from under us at any time, especially for mods that modify internals like this one.

## Known Bugs

* Capes sometimes clip armor
